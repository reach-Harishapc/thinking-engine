“There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom ” (1959) 
“When we get to the very, very small world –say circuits of seven 
atoms –we have a lot of new things that would happen that 
represent completely new opportunities for design .
Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, 
for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics…”

Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is the theory that describes the behavior of microscopic 
systems, such as photons, electrons, atoms, molecules, etc.
Nobody understands quantum mechanics!
“No, you’re not going to be able to understand it.... You see, my physics 
students don’t understand it either. That is because I don’t understand it. 
Nobody does. ... The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature 
as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees  fully with 
an experiment. So I hope that you can accept Nature as She is –absurd”
--Richard Feynman

Classical vs. Quantum Mechanics
Classical Mechanics
•It deals with macroscopic particles
•It is based on Newton’s laws of 
motion and Maxwell’s 
electromagnetic wave theory
•Any amount of energy may be 
emitted or absorbed continuously
•The state of a system is defined 
exactly by specifying their positions 
and velocities 
•The future state can be predicted 
with certaintyQuantum Mechanics
•It deals with microscopic particles
•It is based on the Schrödinger equation
•In Planck’s postulation , only discrete 
values of energy are emitted or absorbed 
–origin of “ quantum ”
•Because of Heisenberg’s uncertainty 
principle and de Broglie hypothesis dual 
nature of matter (both particle & wave), 
the state of a system cannot be specified 
exactly
•It gives probabilities of finding particles at 
various locations in space 
12
Quantum Mechanics
•Quantum states , represented by 
Dirac’s ket, |>, evolve in time 
according to the Schrödinger equation:
•which implies that time evolution is 
described by unitary transformations :
•where | > is the quantum state 
(wavefunction) and H is Hamiltonian
•This theory, which has been 
extensively tested by experiments, is 
probabilistic in nature.  The outcomes 
of measurements on quantum 
systems are not deterministic .
•Between measurements, quantum 
systems evolve according to linear
equations (the Schrödinger equation).  
This means that solutions to the 
equations obey a superposition 
principle :  linear combinations of 
solutions are still solutions .

Quantum Bit -Qubit
•The smallest unit of information in a quantum computer
•It represents the state of the wavefunction | > in Schrödinger  
equation
•A qubit may be in the “on” (1) state or in the “off” (0) state
•Many ways to implement a qubit:
•Nuclear spin in NMR: = |0>, = |1>.
•Photons in a cavity: 0 photon = |0>, 1 photon = |1>
•Energy states of an atom: g.s.|0>, excited state |1>
•Polarization of photon, many others….

Schrödinger equation), linear combinations of solutions are also 
solutions. So, for the state of a qubit|0> and |1>, its superposition 
also describes the same state
•The general form of a qubit state can be represented by:
0|0›+ 1|1›
where 0and 1are complex numbers that specify the probability 
amplitudes of the corresponding states.
•|0|2gives the probability that you will find the qubit in the “off” 
(0) state; | 1|2gives the probability that you will find the qubit in 
the “on” (1) state.
•Normalization condition: | 0|2+ |1|2= 1

Classical Bit vs. Quantum Bit
CLASSICAL BITS :
•can be in two distinct 
states, 0 and 1
•can be measured 
completely
•are not changed by 
measurement
•can be copied
•can be erasedQUANTUM BITS :
•can be in state |0> or in state |1> 
or in any other state that is a linear 
combination of the two states
•can be measured partially with 
given probability
•are changed by measurement
•cannot be copied
•cannot be erased
21
•Adding qubits increases storage exponentially
•Quantum computer doubles the power with every added qubit
•To double the power of a digital computer 32bits -> 64 bits
•To double the power of a quantum computer 32qubits -> 33 qubits
•Can do operations on all superpositions…like massively parallel computation
•One math operation on 2nnumbers encoded in classical computers with n bits 
requires 2nsteps or parallel processors, but the same operation on 2nnumbers 
encoded by n qubits takes 1step
•A 64 -bit computer can perform manipulation on 64 -bit binary numbers at a time.
•A 64 -qubit quantum computer operates in a space of 264 dimensions, or roughly 
16,000,000,000,000,000,000 (16*1018) numbers to specify the state of the quantum system.
•This makes complex problems much easier to solve by quantum computerAdvantages of Qubits & Enormous Quantum Power
22
However, Quantum Systems are SPOOKY!
Schrödinger’s Cat: Superposition
“Icannot seriously believe in[the quantum theory] because itcannot be
reconciled with the idea that physics should represent areality intime and
space, free from spooky actions atadistance .”Albert Einstein, March 1947 .
Entanglement
23Schrödinger’s 
Cat in a black 
box
Superposition
•Every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states. 
Mathematically, it refers to a property of solutions to the Schrödinger equation; since the 
Schrödinger equation is linear, any linear combination of solutions will also be a solution. 
•A single qubit can be forced into a superposition of the two states denoted by the addition of the 
state vectors:
|> = 0|0> + 1|1>
Where 0and 1are complex numbers and | 0|2+ | 1|2= 1
•A qubit in superposition is in both of the states |1> and |0 at the same time 
•If this state is measured, we see only one or the other state (live or dead) with some probability.
•The classic example of superposition is Schrödinger’s Cat in a black box.  Since both a living and 
dead cat are obviously valid solutions to the laws of quantum mechanics, a superposition of the 
two should also be valid.  Schrödinger described a thought experiment that could give rise to 
such a state.
•Consider a 3 -qubit register.  An equally weighted superposition of all possible states would be 
denoted by:
|> =     |000> + |001> + . . . +     |111>

Entanglement
•When a pair or group of particles is generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such 
that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently 
of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance . 
•An entangled pair is a single quantum system in a superposition of equally possible states. The 
entangled state contains no information about the individual particles, only that they are in 
opposite states. 
•If the state of one is changed, the state of the other is instantly adjusted to be consistent with 
quantum mechanical rules. 
•If a measurement is made on one, the other will automatically collapse.
•Quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: 
entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics . 
•Entanglement is a joint characteristic of two or more quantum particles.
•Einstein called it “ spooky actions at a distance ”

Decoherence
•Quantum decoherence is the loss of superposition, because of the 
spontaneous interaction between a quantum system and its 
environment.
•Decoherence can be viewed as the loss of information from a system 
into the environment.
•The reason why quantum computers still have a long way to go 
because superposition and entanglement are extremely fragile states.
•Preventing decoherence remains the biggest challenge in building 
quantum computers.
27
Measurement
•If a quantum system were perfectly isolated, it would maintain coherence 
indefinitely, but it would be impossible to manipulate or investigate it.
•A quantum measure is a decoherence process.
•When a quantum system is measured, the wave function |collapses to a 
new state according to a probabilistic rule.
•If |> = 0|0> + 1|1>, after measurement, either | = |0or |= |1,
and these alternatives occur with certain probabilities of |0|2and | 1|2
with | 0|2+ |1|2=1.
•A quantum measurement never produces |= 0|0> + 1|1>.
•Example : Two qubits: |> = 0.316|00 ›+0.447|01 ›+0.548|10 ›+0.632|11 ›
The probability to read the rightmost bit as 0 is |0.316|2+|0.548|2= 0.4
28
Quantum Gate
•A quantum gate (or quantum logic gate ) is a basic quantum circuit 
operating on qubits. 
•They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic 
gates are for conventional digital circuits
•Due to the normalization condition every gate operation Uhas to be 
unitary: 
•The number of qubits in the input and output of the gate must be 
equal; a gate which acts on n qubits is represented by 2n x 2nunitary 
matrix  
•Unlike many classical logic gates, quantum gates are reversible. 
I UU =*
29
Unitary Matrix
•In linear algebra , a complex square matrix Uis unitary if its conjugate 
transpose U*is also its inverse , that is, if 
where Iis the identity matrix . 
•Unitary transformations are linear transformations that preserve vector norm; 
In 2 dimensions, linear transformations preserve unit circle ( rotations and 
reflections ).
•Examples:
which depends on parameters a, b, φ and.

The Amazing H -Gate
•After aqubit instate |0or|1hasbeen acted upon byaHgate, thestate of
thequbit isanequal superposition of|0and |1.Thus, thequbit goes from a
deterministic state toatruly random state, i.e.,ifthequbit isnow measured,
wewillmeasure |0or|1with equal probability .
•We see that Hisitsown inverse, that is,H−1=HorH2=I.Therefore, by
applying Htwice toaqubit wechange nothing .This isamazing!
•By applying arandomizing operation toarandom state produces a
deterministic outcome!
•One ofthemost important gates inquantum computing!

Quantum Circuit
•A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation in which a 
computation is a sequence of quantum gates with n-qubit register 
linked by “wires”
•The circuit has fixed “width” corresponding to the number of qubits 
being processed
Unlike classical circuits,
the same number of wires
is going throughout the circuit

NISQ –Noisy Intermediate -Scale Quantum Era
•John Preshill of CalTech introduced this terminology in 2018
•https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862
•Quantum computers can do things that classical computers can’t
•But they won't be big enough to provide fault -tolerant 
implementations of the algorithms we know about.
•Noisy because we don't have enough qubits to spare for error 
correction, and so we'll need to directly use the imperfect qubits at 
the physical layer.
•And 'Intermediate -Scale' because of their small (but not too small) 
qubit number (50 -100 qubits).

Case Study 1: Quantum Cryptography
•Alice and Bob wish to establish a secret key, but the communication lines between 
them may be compromised.  Alice sends random q -bits to Bob.  For each one, she 
picks either basis {|0>,|1>} or {|0>|1>} .
•Bob randomly chooses a basis to measure the bit in.  If he guesses wrong, he gets 
a random bit.
•If an eavesdropper Evetries to intercept the q -bits, she doesn’t know (any more 
than Bob) the basis in which they were prepared.  If she guesses wrong, the bit 
she passes on to Bob will have been disturbed.
•After Nbits have been sent, Alice and Bob compare notes as to which bases they 
used.  All bits where their bases didn’t match are discarded.  The remainder 
should be perfectly correlated.

Quantum Teleportation
Explained
63
1)Generate an entangled pair of electrons with spin states A and B, 
in a particular Bell state
2)Separate the entangled electrons, sending A to Alice and B to Bob.
3)Alice measures the "Bell state" (described below) of A and C, 
entangling A and C.
4)Alice sends the result of her measurement to Bob via some 
classical method of communication.
5)Bob measures the spin of state B along an axis determined by 
Alice's measurement•Alice's measurement disentangles A and B and entangles A and 
C. Depending on what particular entangled state Alice sees, Bob 
will know exactly how B was disentangled, and can manipulate B 
to take the state that C had originally. Thus, the state C was 
"teleported" from Alice to Bob, who now has a state that looks 
identical to how C originally looked.
•It is important to note that state C is not preserved in the 
processes: the no-cloning and no-deletion theorems of quantum 
mechanics prevent quantum information from being perfectly 
replicated or destroyed. 
•Bob receives a state that looks like C did originally, but Alice no 
longer has the original state C in the end, since it is now in an 
entangled state with A. 
Case Study 2: Shor Algorithm of Factoring
•Theorem of Number Theory
•If a ±b(mod N) but a2b2(mod N), then gcd(a+b,N ) is a factor of N.
•To Factor N on a quantum computer:
•Select xcoprime to N
•Use QFT on quantum computer to find the period of
•Use order of xto compute possible factors of N.
•Check if they work;  If not, rerun. 
•Best classical algorithm takes time 
But Shor ’s quantum algorithm  takes time

Case Study 3: Variational Quantum Eigensolver 
•VQE is a quantum/classical hybrid algorithm that can be used to find 
eigenvalues of a matrix H.
•When VQE is used in quantum simulations, H is typical the Hamiltonian of an 
electronic system.
•It is run inside of a classical optimization loop.
•The quantum part has two fundamental steps:
•Prepare the quantum states | >, often called the ansatz;
•Measure the expectation value < |H|>
•The classical optimization loop does two tasks:
•Use a classical non -linear optimizer to minimize the expectation value by varying ansatz 
parameters
•Iterate until convergence is reached.

VQE Procedures
●The Hamiltonian of the system is mapped to a qubit Hamiltonian
●A  trial wavefunction is picked 
●A quantum circuit is applied to prepare the desired state. The quantum circuit used in the 
variational eigensolver is a Hadamard gate applied to each qubit to create a superimposed 
state, followed by a y and z rotation (Ry , Rz)
●The energy of the trial state is estimated by a classic optimizer 
●Varies the parameters of the state to redo the loop
●Loops until the energy minimization condition is met

Post -Quantum World
There is a good chance that quantum computers will be able to crack RSA -2048 within five -ten years 
(need about 8,000 qubits in a universal computer to do this).
Some encrypted data has a shelf -life of more than ten years. It may take ten years to cut over to a new 
encryption scheme, so companies and governments are scrambling to figure out what to do.
Most encryption used today is not safe in a quantum world. 
If someone has been recording a https session, say, they may not be able to decrypt it now, but a few 
years from now, who knows.
There are encryption algorithms that are safe:
Secure communications will move to symmetric encryption or hash algorithms, or perhaps lattice 
algorithms.
QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) will likely be more popular for the most sensitive communications
Some governments and banks are already starting to use “Quantum Safe” algorithms, and this is 
expected to increase over the next decade.

Neven ’s Law ,named after Hartmut Neven ,the director of 
Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, stated that 
quantum processors grow at a doubly -exponential rate .Qubit count of general -purpose quantum 
computers will double roughly every one to two 
years, or roughly every 18months on average.
Problems with Quantum Computers
•Decoherence
•Quantum system is extremely sensitive to external environment, so it should 
be safely isolated
•It is hard to achieve the decoherence time that is more than the algorithm 
running time
•Error correction (requires more qubits!)
•Physical implementation of computations
•New quantum algorithms to solve more problems
•Entangled states for data transfer
•Running time increases exponentially with matrix size
