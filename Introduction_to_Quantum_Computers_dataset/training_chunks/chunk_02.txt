“There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom ” (1959) 
“When we get to the very, very small world –say circuits of seven 
atoms –we have a lot of new things that would happen that 
represent completely new opportunities for design .
Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, 
for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics…”

Moore’s law will soon 
run into major 
physical constraints!Moore's law is the observation 
that the number of transistors in a 
dense integrated circuit doubles 
about every two years.

What is a quantum computer?
➢Quantum Computer
➢A computer that uses laws of quantum mechanics to perform massively 
parallel computing through superposition, entanglement, and de coherence .
➢Classical Computer
➢A computer that uses voltages flowing through circuits and gates, which 
can be controlled and manipulated entirely by classical mechanics.

Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is the theory that describes the behavior of microscopic 
systems, such as photons, electrons, atoms, molecules, etc.
Nobody understands quantum mechanics!
“No, you’re not going to be able to understand it.... You see, my physics 
students don’t understand it either. That is because I don’t understand it. 
Nobody does. ... The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature 
as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees  fully with 
an experiment. So I hope that you can accept Nature as She is –absurd”
--Richard Feynman

Classical vs. Quantum Mechanics
Classical Mechanics
•It deals with macroscopic particles
•It is based on Newton’s laws of 
motion and Maxwell’s 
electromagnetic wave theory
•Any amount of energy may be 
emitted or absorbed continuously
•The state of a system is defined 
exactly by specifying their positions 
and velocities 
•The future state can be predicted 
with certaintyQuantum Mechanics
•It deals with microscopic particles
•It is based on the Schrödinger equation
•In Planck’s postulation , only discrete 
values of energy are emitted or absorbed 
–origin of “ quantum ”
•Because of Heisenberg’s uncertainty 
principle and de Broglie hypothesis dual 
nature of matter (both particle & wave), 
the state of a system cannot be specified 
exactly
•It gives probabilities of finding particles at 
various locations in space 
12
Quantum Mechanics
•Quantum states , represented by 
Dirac’s ket, |>, evolve in time 
according to the Schrödinger equation:
•which implies that time evolution is 
described by unitary transformations :
•where | > is the quantum state 
(wavefunction) and H is Hamiltonian
•This theory, which has been 
extensively tested by experiments, is 
probabilistic in nature.  The outcomes 
of measurements on quantum 
systems are not deterministic .
•Between measurements, quantum 
systems evolve according to linear
equations (the Schrödinger equation).  
This means that solutions to the 
equations obey a superposition 
principle :  linear combinations of 
solutions are still solutions .

The initial preparation of the state defines a 
wave function at time t0=0.

nSTATE EVOLUTION :
Evolved by a sequence of unitary operations
MEASUREMENT :
Quantum measurement is projective.
