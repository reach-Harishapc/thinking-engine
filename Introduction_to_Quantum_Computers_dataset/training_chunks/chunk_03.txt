Quantum Bit -Qubit
•The smallest unit of information in a quantum computer
•It represents the state of the wavefunction | > in Schrödinger  
equation
•A qubit may be in the “on” (1) state or in the “off” (0) state
•Many ways to implement a qubit:
•Nuclear spin in NMR: = |0>, = |1>.
•Photons in a cavity: 0 photon = |0>, 1 photon = |1>
•Energy states of an atom: g.s.|0>, excited state |1>
•Polarization of photon, many others….

Schrödinger equation), linear combinations of solutions are also 
solutions. So, for the state of a qubit|0> and |1>, its superposition 
also describes the same state
•The general form of a qubit state can be represented by:
0|0›+ 1|1›
where 0and 1are complex numbers that specify the probability 
amplitudes of the corresponding states.
•|0|2gives the probability that you will find the qubit in the “off” 
(0) state; | 1|2gives the probability that you will find the qubit in 
the “on” (1) state.
•Normalization condition: | 0|2+ |1|2= 1

Classical Bit vs. Quantum Bit
CLASSICAL BITS :
•can be in two distinct 
states, 0 and 1
•can be measured 
completely
•are not changed by 
measurement
•can be copied
•can be erasedQUANTUM BITS :
•can be in state |0> or in state |1> 
or in any other state that is a linear 
combination of the two states
•can be measured partially with 
given probability
•are changed by measurement
•cannot be copied
•cannot be erased

•Adding qubits increases storage exponentially
•Quantum computer doubles the power with every added qubit
•To double the power of a digital computer 32bits -> 64 bits
•To double the power of a quantum computer 32qubits -> 33 qubits
•Can do operations on all superpositions…like massively parallel computation
•One math operation on 2nnumbers encoded in classical computers with n bits 
requires 2nsteps or parallel processors, but the same operation on 2nnumbers 
encoded by n qubits takes 1step
•A 64 -bit computer can perform manipulation on 64 -bit binary numbers at a time.
•A 64 -qubit quantum computer operates in a space of 264 dimensions, or roughly 
16,000,000,000,000,000,000 (16*1018) numbers to specify the state of the quantum system.
•This makes complex problems much easier to solve by quantum computerAdvantages of Qubits & Enormous Quantum Power

However, Quantum Systems are SPOOKY!
Schrödinger’s Cat: Superposition
“Icannot seriously believe in[the quantum theory] because itcannot be
reconciled with the idea that physics should represent areality intime and
space, free from spooky actions atadistance .”Albert Einstein, March 1947 .

•Every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states. 
Mathematically, it refers to a property of solutions to the Schrödinger equation; since the 
Schrödinger equation is linear, any linear combination of solutions will also be a solution. 
•A single qubit can be forced into a superposition of the two states denoted by the addition of the 
state vectors:
|> = 0|0> + 1|1>
Where 0and 1are complex numbers and | 0|2+ | 1|2= 1
•A qubit in superposition is in both of the states |1> and |0 at the same time 
•If this state is measured, we see only one or the other state (live or dead) with some probability.
•The classic example of superposition is Schrödinger’s Cat in a black box.  Since both a living and 
dead cat are obviously valid solutions to the laws of quantum mechanics, a superposition of the 
two should also be valid.  Schrödinger described a thought experiment that could give rise to 
such a state.
•Consider a 3 -qubit register.  An equally weighted superposition of all possible states would be 
denoted by:
|> =     |000> + |001> + . . . +     |111>

Entanglement
•When a pair or group of particles is generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such 
that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently 
of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance . 
•An entangled pair is a single quantum system in a superposition of equally possible states. The 
entangled state contains no information about the individual particles, only that they are in 
opposite states. 
•If the state of one is changed, the state of the other is instantly adjusted to be consistent with 
quantum mechanical rules. 
•If a measurement is made on one, the other will automatically collapse.
•Quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: 
entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics . 
•Entanglement is a joint characteristic of two or more quantum particles.
•Einstein called it “ spooky actions at a distance ”
