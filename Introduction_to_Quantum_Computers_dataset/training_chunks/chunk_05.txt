The Amazing H -Gate
•After aqubit instate |0or|1hasbeen acted upon byaHgate, thestate of
thequbit isanequal superposition of|0and |1.Thus, thequbit goes from a
deterministic state toatruly random state, i.e.,ifthequbit isnow measured,
wewillmeasure |0or|1with equal probability .
•We see that Hisitsown inverse, that is,H−1=HorH2=I.Therefore, by
applying Htwice toaqubit wechange nothing .This isamazing!
•By applying arandomizing operation toarandom state produces a
deterministic outcome!
•One ofthemost important gates inquantum computing!
34
CNOT Gate
•Controlled NOT gate
•Acts on two qubits
-If the control qubit is set to 0, target qubit is the same
-If the control qubit is set to 1, target qubit is flipped
•Equivalent to classical gate operation XORMatrix representation Circuit representation

Quantum Circuit
•A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation in which a 
computation is a sequence of quantum gates with n-qubit register 
linked by “wires”
•The circuit has fixed “width” corresponding to the number of qubits 
being processed
Unlike classical circuits,
the same number of wires
is going throughout the circuit

Quantum Algorithms
•It may be possible to solve a problem on a quantum system much faster (i.e., 
using fewer steps) than on a classical computer
•Factoring and searching are examples of problems where quantum algorithms 
are known and are faster than any classical ones
•Implications for cryptography, information security
•What makes a quantum algorithm potentially faster than
any classical one?
•Quantum parallelism: by using superpositions of quantum states, the computer is 
executing the algorithm on all possible inputs at once
•Dimension of quantum Hilbert space: the “size” of the state space for the quantum 
system is exponentially larger than the corresponding classical system
•Entanglement capability: different subsystems (qubits) in a quantum computer become 
entangled, exhibiting nonclassical correlations

NISQ –Noisy Intermediate -Scale Quantum Era
•John Preshill of CalTech introduced this terminology in 2018
•https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862
•Quantum computers can do things that classical computers can’t
•But they won't be big enough to provide fault -tolerant 
implementations of the algorithms we know about.
•Noisy because we don't have enough qubits to spare for error 
correction, and so we'll need to directly use the imperfect qubits at 
the physical layer.
•And 'Intermediate -Scale' because of their small (but not too small) 
qubit number (50 -100 qubits).

Case Study 1: Quantum Cryptography
•Alice and Bob wish to establish a secret key, but the communication lines between 
them may be compromised.  Alice sends random q -bits to Bob.  For each one, she 
picks either basis {|0>,|1>} or {|0>|1>} .
•Bob randomly chooses a basis to measure the bit in.  If he guesses wrong, he gets 
a random bit.
•If an eavesdropper Evetries to intercept the q -bits, she doesn’t know (any more 
than Bob) the basis in which they were prepared.  If she guesses wrong, the bit 
she passes on to Bob will have been disturbed.
•After Nbits have been sent, Alice and Bob compare notes as to which bases they 
used.  All bits where their bases didn’t match are discarded.  The remainder 
should be perfectly correlated.
