Quantum Teleportation
Explained
63
1)Generate an entangled pair of electrons with spin states A and B, 
in a particular Bell state
2)Separate the entangled electrons, sending A to Alice and B to Bob.
3)Alice measures the "Bell state" (described below) of A and C, 
entangling A and C.
4)Alice sends the result of her measurement to Bob via some 
classical method of communication.
5)Bob measures the spin of state B along an axis determined by 
Alice's measurement•Alice's measurement disentangles A and B and entangles A and 
C. Depending on what particular entangled state Alice sees, Bob 
will know exactly how B was disentangled, and can manipulate B 
to take the state that C had originally. Thus, the state C was 
"teleported" from Alice to Bob, who now has a state that looks 
identical to how C originally looked.
•It is important to note that state C is not preserved in the 
processes: the no-cloning and no-deletion theorems of quantum 
mechanics prevent quantum information from being perfectly 
replicated or destroyed. 
•Bob receives a state that looks like C did originally, but Alice no 
longer has the original state C in the end, since it is now in an 
entangled state with A. 
Case Study 2: Shor Algorithm of Factoring
•Theorem of Number Theory
•If a ±b(mod N) but a2b2(mod N), then gcd(a+b,N ) is a factor of N.
•To Factor N on a quantum computer:
•Select xcoprime to N
•Use QFT on quantum computer to find the period of
•Use order of xto compute possible factors of N.
•Check if they work;  If not, rerun. 
•Best classical algorithm takes time 
But Shor ’s quantum algorithm  takes time

Case Study 3: Variational Quantum Eigensolver 
•VQE is a quantum/classical hybrid algorithm that can be used to find 
eigenvalues of a matrix H.
•When VQE is used in quantum simulations, H is typical the Hamiltonian of an 
electronic system.
•It is run inside of a classical optimization loop.
•The quantum part has two fundamental steps:
•Prepare the quantum states | >, often called the ansatz;
•Measure the expectation value < |H|>
•The classical optimization loop does two tasks:
•Use a classical non -linear optimizer to minimize the expectation value by varying ansatz 
parameters
•Iterate until convergence is reached.

VQE Procedures
●The Hamiltonian of the system is mapped to a qubit Hamiltonian
●A  trial wavefunction is picked 
●A quantum circuit is applied to prepare the desired state. The quantum circuit used in the 
variational eigensolver is a Hadamard gate applied to each qubit to create a superimposed 
state, followed by a y and z rotation (Ry , Rz)
●The energy of the trial state is estimated by a classic optimizer 
●Varies the parameters of the state to redo the loop
●Loops until the energy minimization condition is met

Post -Quantum World
There is a good chance that quantum computers will be able to crack RSA -2048 within five -ten years 
(need about 8,000 qubits in a universal computer to do this).
Some encrypted data has a shelf -life of more than ten years. It may take ten years to cut over to a new 
encryption scheme, so companies and governments are scrambling to figure out what to do.
Most encryption used today is not safe in a quantum world. 
If someone has been recording a https session, say, they may not be able to decrypt it now, but a few 
years from now, who knows.
There are encryption algorithms that are safe:
Secure communications will move to symmetric encryption or hash algorithms, or perhaps lattice 
algorithms.
QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) will likely be more popular for the most sensitive communications
Some governments and banks are already starting to use “Quantum Safe” algorithms, and this is 
expected to increase over the next decade.

Neven ’s Law ,named after Hartmut Neven ,the director of 
Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, stated that 
quantum processors grow at a doubly -exponential rate .Qubit count of general -purpose quantum 
computers will double roughly every one to two 
years, or roughly every 18months on average.
Problems with Quantum Computers
•Decoherence
•Quantum system is extremely sensitive to external environment, so it should 
be safely isolated
•It is hard to achieve the decoherence time that is more than the algorithm 
running time
•Error correction (requires more qubits!)
•Physical implementation of computations
•New quantum algorithms to solve more problems
•Entangled states for data transfer
•Running time increases exponentially with matrix size
