Decoherence
•Quantum decoherence is the loss of superposition, because of the 
spontaneous interaction between a quantum system and its 
environment.
•Decoherence can be viewed as the loss of information from a system 
into the environment.
•The reason why quantum computers still have a long way to go 
because superposition and entanglement are extremely fragile states.
•Preventing decoherence remains the biggest challenge in building 
quantum computers.

Measurement
•If a quantum system were perfectly isolated, it would maintain coherence 
indefinitely, but it would be impossible to manipulate or investigate it.
•A quantum measure is a decoherence process.
•When a quantum system is measured, the wave function |collapses to a 
new state according to a probabilistic rule.
•If |> = 0|0> + 1|1>, after measurement, either | = |0or |= |1,
and these alternatives occur with certain probabilities of |0|2and | 1|2
with | 0|2+ |1|2=1.
•A quantum measurement never produces |= 0|0> + 1|1>.
•Example : Two qubits: |> = 0.316|00 ›+0.447|01 ›+0.548|10 ›+0.632|11 ›
The probability to read the rightmost bit as 0 is |0.316|2+|0.548|2= 0.4

Quantum Gate
•A quantum gate (or quantum logic gate ) is a basic quantum circuit 
operating on qubits. 
•They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic 
gates are for conventional digital circuits
•Due to the normalization condition every gate operation Uhas to be 
unitary: 
•The number of qubits in the input and output of the gate must be 
equal; a gate which acts on n qubits is represented by 2n x 2nunitary 
matrix  
•Unlike many classical logic gates, quantum gates are reversible.

Unitary Matrix
•In linear algebra , a complex square matrix Uis unitary if its conjugate 
transpose U*is also its inverse , that is, if 
where Iis the identity matrix . 
•Unitary transformations are linear transformations that preserve vector norm; 
In 2 dimensions, linear transformations preserve unit circle ( rotations and 
reflections ).
•Examples:
which depends on parameters a, b, φ and.
