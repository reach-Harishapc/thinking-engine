Since both a living and \ndead cat are obviously valid solutions to the laws of quantum mechanics, a superposition of the \ntwo should also be valid.  Schrödinger described a thought experiment that could give rise to \nsuch a state.\n•Consider a 3 -qubit register.

The \nentangled state contains no information about the individual particles, only that they are in \nopposite states. \n•If the state of one is changed, the state of the other is instantly adjusted to be consistent with \nquantum mechanical rules. \n•If a measurement is made on one, the other will automatically collapse.\n•Quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: \nentanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics . \n•Entanglement is a joint characteristic of two or more quantum particles.\n•Einstein called it “ spooky actions at a distance ”\n25\n26\n( )( ) 11' 10' 01' 00' 1' 0'1 0 ββ βα αβ ααβαβα + + + = + +The state of the combined system is their tensor product :Suppose that two qubits are in states: \n1 0+ \n1' 0' + Entanglement\n11 10 01 0021\n21\n21\n21− − +\nQuestion: what are the states of the individual qubits for\n1.\n2.\n11 0021\n21+ an entangled statean independent state",

Alice sends random q -bits to Bob.  For each one, she \npicks either basis {|0>,|1>} or {|0>|1>} .\n•Bob randomly chooses a basis to measure the bit in.  If he guesses wrong, he gets \na random bit.\n•If an eavesdropper Evetries to intercept the q -bits, she doesn’t know (any more \nthan Bob) the basis in which they were prepared.  If she guesses wrong, the bit \nshe passes on to Bob will have been disturbed.\n•After Nbits have been sent, Alice and Bob compare notes as to which bases they \nused.  All bits where their bases didn’t match are discarded.  The remainder \nshould be perfectly correlated.\n61\nCase Study 1: Quantum Cryptography\n62",

Depending on what particular entangled state Alice sees, Bob \nwill know exactly how B was disentangled, and can manipulate B \nto take the state that C had originally. Thus, the state C was \n\"teleported\" from Alice to Bob, who now has a state that looks \nidentical to how C originally looked.\n•It is important to note that state C is not preserved in the \nprocesses: the no-cloning and no-deletion theorems of quantum \nmechanics prevent quantum information from being perfectly \nreplicated or destroyed. \n•Bob receives a state that looks like C did originally, but Alice no \nlonger has the original state C in the end, since it is now in an \nentangled state with A. \nCase Study 2: Shor Algorithm of Factoring\n•Theorem of Number Theory\n•If a ±b(mod N) but a2b2(mod N), then gcd(a+b,N ) is a factor of N.\n•To Factor N on a quantum computer:\n•Select xcoprime to N\n•Use QFT on quantum computer to find the period of\n•Use order of xto compute possible factors of N.\n•Check if they work;  If not, rerun. \n•Best classical algorithm takes time \nBut Shor ’s quantum algorithm  takes time\nPeter Shor 1994\n64\nQuantum Fourier Transform (QFT)\n65\nCase Study 2: Shor Algorithm of Factoring\n4727721461074353025362\n2307197304822463291469\n5302097116459852171130\n5207112563635903975273980750864240649373971\n2550055038649119906436\n2342526708406385189575\n9463889572617685833171881988129206079 6383 869723946 165043\n980716356337941 7382700763356 4229888\n5971523466548531 90606065047 43045 317\n3880113033967161996 92321205 73403187\n955065699622130 5168 75930765 0257059\n66\nCase Study 3: Variational Quantum Eigensolver \n•VQE is a quantum/classical hybrid algorithm that can be used to find \neigenvalues of a matrix H.\n•When VQE is used in quantum simulations, H is typical the Hamiltonian of an \nelectronic system.\n•It is run inside of a classical optimization loop.\n•The quantum part has two fundamental steps:\n•Prepare the quantum states | >, often called the ansatz;\n•Measure the expectation value < |H|>\n•The classical optimization loop does two tasks:\n•Use a classical non -linear optimizer to minimize the expectation value by varying ansatz \nparameters\n•Iterate until convergence is reached.\nNature Communications , 5, 4213, (2014).\nNew J.
